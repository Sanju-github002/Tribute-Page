          <h3>Here's a time line of Subhas Chandra Boss's life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1897</strong> - Cuttack, Orissa Division, Bengal Province, British India (present-day Cuttack, Odisha state, India)</li>
             <li><strong>1897–1921: Early life</strong> - For some time before Subhas Bose had been in touch with C. R. Das, a lawyer who had risen to the helm of politics in Bengal; Das encouraged Subhas to return to Calcutta.[68] With the ICS decision now firmly behind him, Subhas Bose took his Cambridge B.A. Final examinations half-heartedly, passing, but being placed in the Third Class.[67] He prepared to sail for India in June 1921, electing for a fellow Indian student to pick up his diploma</li>  
            <li><strong>1921–1932: Indian National Congress</strong> - Bose worked as the CEO of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for Das when the latter was elected mayor of Calcutta in 1924. A little later, Bose was again arrested and jailed for civil disobedience; this time he emerged to become Mayor of Calcutta in 1930.</li>  
            <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>  
            <li><strong>1933–1937: Illness, Austria, Emilie Schenkl</strong> - During the mid-1930s Bose travelled in Europe, visiting Indian students and European politicians, including Benito Mussolini. He observed party organisation and saw communism and fascism in action.[citation needed] In this period, he also researched and wrote the first part of his book The Indian Struggle, which covered the country's independence movement in the years 1920–1934. Although it was published in London in 1935, the British government banned the book in the colony out of fears that it would encourage unrest.</li>  
            <li><strong>1937–1940: Indian National Congress</strong> - He came to believe that an independent India needed socialist authoritarianism, on the lines of Turkey's Kemal Atatürk, for at least two decades. For political reasons Bose was refused permission by the British authorities to meet Atatürk at Ankara.</li>  
            <li><strong>1941–1943:</strong> - In all, 3,000 Indian prisoners of war signed up for the Free India Legion. But instead of being delighted, Bose was worried. A left-wing admirer of Russia, he was devastated when Hitler's tanks rolled across the Soviet border.  
            <li><strong>1943–1945:</strong> - After being disillusioned that Germany could be of any help in gaining India's independence, Bose left for Japan. He travelled with the German submarine U-180 around the Cape of Good Hope to the southeast of Madagascar, where he was transferred to the I-29 for the rest of the journey to Imperial Japan. This was the only civilian transfer between two submarines of two different navies in World War II. </li>
            <li><strong>1945(aged 48)</strong> - 	18 August 1945 (aged 48)
                Army Hospital Nanmon Branch, Taihoku, Japanese Taiwan (present-day Taipei City Hospital Heping Fuyou Branch, Taipei, Taiwan)</li>
                <li><strong>Cause of death</strong>	Third-degree burns from aircrash</li>
          </ul>
          
          <i>"We should have but one desire today - the desire to die so that India may live - the desire to face a martyr's death, so that the path to freedom may be paved with the martyr's blood."</i> <br><br>
          <i>-- "Subhash Chandra Bose" </i>
